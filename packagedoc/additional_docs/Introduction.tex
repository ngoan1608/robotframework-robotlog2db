\href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-testresultwebapptool}{RobotResults2DB}
tool helps to import robot \emph{output.xml} result file(s) to
\href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp}{TestResultWebApp}'s
database for presenting an overview about the execution and detail of
each test result.

In order to display the \rfwcore\ results on
\href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp}{TestResultWebApp}
Dashboard properly, Robot testcase need to give some required
information for management such as project/variant, software version,
component, ...

Therefore, \rcode{Metadata} and \rcode{[Tags]} are used to provide
that information to \emph{output.xml} result which is used for importing
data to WebApp.

However, you can also provide required information as arguments when executing
RobotResults2DB tool.
